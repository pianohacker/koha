    # The authentication strategy for the biblios web
    # services is as follows.
    #
    # 1. biblios POSTs to the authenticate API with URL-encoded
    # form parameters 'userid' and 'password'.  If the credentials
    # belong to a valid user with the 'editcatalogue' privilege,
    # a session cookie is returned and a Koha session created.  Otherwise, an
    # appropriate error is returned.
    # 2. For subsequent calls to the biblios APIs, the user agent
    # should submit the same session cookie.  If the cookie is
    # not supplied or does not correspond to a valid session, the API
    # will redirect to this authentication API.
    # 3. The session cookie should not be (directly) sent back to the user's
    # web browser, but instead should be stored and submitted by biblios.
